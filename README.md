# FaceLandmark Tracker & Graph Traversal Visualizer 🎯🔍

This application combines face landmark tracking with graph traversal visualization. It allows users to track 468 landmarks of a face in a video, store the landmark data in MongoDB, and replay the landmark motion. Additionally, users can visualize graph traversal algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), A* algorithm, and Dijkstra's algorithm across the landmarks.

## Installation and Usage 🛠️📝

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/karan-panda/Face-Landmarks-and-Graph-traversals
```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Ensure MongoDB is Running**: Make sure MongoDB is running locally on your machine. If not, start the MongoDB service.

### Usage

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. **Run the GUI Application**: Launch the graphical user interface (GUI) by running the `main.py` script:
```
python main.py
```

3. **Click on Landmark Generator**: To track face landmarks in a video, click on the "Landmark Generator" button. This will initiate the process of detecting and tracking 468 landmarks of a face in the video.

4. **Replay Landmark Motion**: After generating the landmarks, you can replay the motion of face landmarks by clicking on the "Landmark Motion Visualizer" button. This will visualize the tracked landmarks and their motion.
